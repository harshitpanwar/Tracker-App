# Tracker-App
This App has been coded using the latest MVVM pattern for android.
The app tracks the user's progress while running.
The app runs in the background while showing a permanent notification about the little details like the time and distance travelled.
At the end of any run the app shows the total distance travelled by the user, the ammount of calories burned by the user, and the time, the user took to make this run.
